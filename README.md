change to simplex_algorithn.py 06/30/2025:
 1. lines 60 and 104, added discard function to power sets to remove issue of adding empty set to complex
 2. lines 65-67, added an if statement so that only new changes would be reported to terminal, and would not report no change to complex, i.e. stopped printing "Added [] to complex"
